# Thread Reaper

A simple utitlity to convert [Thread Reader](https://threadreaderapp.com/) pages into simpler HTML pages.

Usage:
	./threadreaper URL ["TITLE"] > local_page.html
	./threadreaper https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1202293011150852096.html "On Binbary Numbers" > foone_binary.html

This program also fixes an issue with embedded images that you would have if you were to simply download the Thread Reader HTML to disk.
